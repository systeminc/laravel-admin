# Laravel Administration Panel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/systeminc/laravel-admin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/systeminc/laravel-admin) [![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/65193755/shield)](https://styleci.io/repos/65193755)

This is **Laravel Admin**, CRUD (create, read, update and delete) package that can help you get your administration panel in minutes. At this moment we support these modules:

- **Pages** (page elements, subpages, images, html editor)
- **Galleries** (images, change order)
- **Blog** (posts, comments)
- **Shop** (products, categories, comments, orders, stock)
- **Places** (locations, maps)
- **Leads** (contacts, subscriptions)
- **Multiple admins**

Once you have your administration panel up, you can easily put all of those elements wherever you want in you application files. For usage documentation see **Usage section** bellow.

Supports Laravel 5.1 -> 5.4.

## Installation

Install using composer:

```
composer require systeminc/laravel-admin
```

Add the service provider to the `'providers'` array in `config/app.php`:

```php
SystemInc\LaravelAdmin\AdminServiceProvider::class,
```

If you want to use this package as a facade, add this line to the `$aliases` array in `config/app.php`.

```php
'SLA' => SystemInc\LaravelAdmin\Facades\SLA::class,
```

Start package installation by running instal command below:

```php
php artisan laravel-admin:instal
```
If you want to instal package again from scratch, just delete the `config/laravel-admin.php` file and run install command again.

If our package update throws composer error, try updating dependencies manually with commend below:

```php
php artisan laravel-admin:update
```

Note that this installation uses migrations, so you must run it from machine that has access to your database. 

For instance, if you use Vagrant, you will have to do `vagrant ssh` first, go to your project directory, and run this instal command. The same way you run your standard Laravel's migration command.
